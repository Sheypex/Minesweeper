# format: "{width}_x_{height},_{mines}"
#   (with 'width', 'height' and 'mines' as Integers)
#   '_' means a multiple of " " ('space's) and/or "    " (\t or 'tab's)
#       " " ('space's) and "    " (\t or 'tab's) can be mixed
#   the actual regEx is "\d+( |\t)+x( |\t)+\d+,( |\t)+\d+" for that matter
#       (This is addressed to all those interested; do not feel concerned if you don't understand what this means)
# a line does not strictly have to end in a new line (\n)
# lines preceded with '#' won't take effect
# entries must be separated by a new line as only the first part of the line fitting the format will be recognized and \
#   take effect
# -> anything other than that part of the line is therefor ignored, inline comments at the end of a line do therefor not \
#   need to be preceded by a '#'
# full line comments do not strictly have to either but should for clarity, although that's up to the user (- I reckon)
