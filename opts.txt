# format: "{var_name}_=_{value}"
#   (with 'var_name' as String and 'value' as any)
#   '_' means a multiple of " " ('space's) and/or "    " (\t or 'tab's)
#       " " ('space's) and "    " (\t or 'tab's) can be mixed
#   the actual regEx is "\w+( |\t)+=( |\t)+\S+" for that matter
#       (This is addressed to all those interested; do not feel concerned if you don't understand what this means)
# a line does not strictly have to end in a new line (\n)
# lines preceded with '#' won't take effect
# entries must be separated by a new line as things would break otherwise
# entries/lines must end in \n or in the last character of a value
#   -> e.g. "name" = "value"_\n     with '_' as a space is illegal
# full line comments do not strictly have to either but should for clarity, although that's up to the user (- I reckon)
